# Simple Stock Market Simulator

Simple Stock Market Simulator is, as the name suggests, a "simple" stock market sim. Here are some examples of this simplicity:

* Simple install - SSMS runs on vanilla Python, with only standard modules required! SSMS will run out of the box on most Linux distributions.
* Simple usage -
1. Edit settings.py.
2. Run data_generate.py to generate data.
3. Run data_viewer.py to view the data!
* Simple code - SSMS's crude stock market "model" and design is not complicated and easy to understand.

Note that as it is a "simple" program, there are very few features included. There are no recessions or events (these features may come later). The price changes generated in this "sim" are PURELY RANDOM and NOT based on real life information or any kind of precise simulation.

DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES USE THIS PROGRAM FOR SERIOUS PURPOSES, INCLUDING STOCK SPECULATION AND RESEARCH.

SSMS3, unlike previous versions, requires Python3, specifically Python 3.6+.
